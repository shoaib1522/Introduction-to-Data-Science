    "#### - Logical errors / Exceptions: \n",
    "Raised during the execution of a syntactically correct program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. An exception is a Python object that represents an error. Some common exceptions in Python are, **ZeroDivisionError** (Raised when you perform a division by zero), **ValueError** (Raised when a function or built-in operation receives an argument which may be of correct type but does not have suitable value), **IndexError** (Raised when you try to refer a sequence which is out of range), **IOError** (Raised when an IO operation fails, e.g.,  trying to open a file that do not exist), **EOFError** (Raised when there is no input from input() function and the end of file is reached), **ImportError** (Raised whan an import statement fails to find the module)\n",
    "#### - Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions\n",
    "Checked Exceptions are the exceptions which occur at compile time (e.g., file not found, no such function, ...)\n",
    "Unchecked Exception arethe exceptions which are not checked by the compiler (e.g., arithmetic exception, array out of bound, ...). If not handled by programmer properly, the program terminate at runtime. Almost no language but Java has checked exceptions. Since Python is not compiled, so checked exceptions don't make much sense."
