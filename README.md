## Getting Started 💻

### Prerequisites:
To follow along with the notebooks, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python (preferably Python 3.x)
- Anaconda (for managing environments and packages)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)

You can install Anaconda and Jupyter by following the official guides [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shoaib1522/introduction-to-data-science.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd introduction-to-data-science
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Start exploring the notebooks! 🎉

## Example Visualization 📊

Here’s an example of how you can visualize data using `matplotlib`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a simple plot
plt.plot(x, y, label='Sine Wave', color='b')
plt.title('Sine Wave Visualization')
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis (sin(x))')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This will produce a sine wave plot like this:
